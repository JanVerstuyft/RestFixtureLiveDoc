The .RestFixture is a [[FitNesse][http://fitnesse.org]] fixture that allows developers and/or product owners to write
test fixtures for REST services with simplicity in mind. The idea is to write tests that are self documenting and easy
to write and read, without the need to write Java code.

The fixture allows test writers to express tests as actions (any of the allowed HTTP methods) to operate on resource
URIs and express expectations on the content of the return code, headers and body. All without writing one single line
of Java code.

And it also works as a living/executable documentation of the API.
