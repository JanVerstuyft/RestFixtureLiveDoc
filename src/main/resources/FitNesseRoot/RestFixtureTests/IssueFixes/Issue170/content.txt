!3 [[Issue #170][https://github.com/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/170]] How to validate HTML

The issue refers to inability to extract XPath from html.
Actually the html in the Issue #170 redefines the default namespace.
{{{
<html xmlns="http://www.foo.org/">
<head>
<title>ACS Simulator</title>
...
}}}

This is not supported by XPath and .RestFixture

|Table: Rest Fixture |http://${jettyHost}:${jettyPort} |
| GET | /files/support/issue170.html |  | | |
| let | title | body | //title/text() | |
